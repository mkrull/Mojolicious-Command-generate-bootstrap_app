NAME
    Mojolicious::Command::generate::bootstrap_app - Generates a basic
    application with simple DBIC-based authentication featuring Twitter
    Bootstrap.

VERSION
    Version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
    This command generate an application with a DBIx::Class model and a
    simple authentication controller.

    To generate an app run:

        mojo generate bootstrap_app My::Bootstrap::App

    This will create the directory structure with a default YAML config and
    basic testing.

        cd my_bootstrap_app

    To get database version and migration management you should install
    DBIx::Class::Migration.

    The default database is an SQLite database that gets installed into
    share/my_bootstrap_app.db. If you would like to change the database edit
    your config.yml accordingly.

    If installed you can use script/migration as a thin wrapper around
    dbic-migration setting lib and the correct database already. Running:

        script/migrate prepare
        script/migrate install
        script/migrate populate

    Prepare generates the SQL files needed, install actually creates the
    database schema and populate will populate the database with the data
    from share/fixtures. So edit those to customize the default user.

    If you do not have and do not want DBIx::Class::Migrate you can
    initialize the database with:

        script/migrate --init

    Now run the test to check if everything went right.

        script/my_bootstrap_app test

FILES
    The file structure generated is very similar to the non lite app with a
    few differences:

        |-- config.yml                                     => your applications config file
        |                                                     contains the database connection details and more

        |           |   |                                     all controllers inherit from this
        |           |   |                                     so application wide controller code goes here
